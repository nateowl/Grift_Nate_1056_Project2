      <h2> About the Brewery </h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Nestled in the heart of Muskoka, Muskoka Brewery handcrafts premium beers as unique and refreshing as the region they’re from.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Founders Gary McMullen and Kirk Evans kicked open the doors of Muskoka Brewery in June of 1996. Currently owned and operated by Todd Lewin and Bob MacDonald, what started as a very small and dedicated team has quickly grown to a passionate band of beer lovers more than 130 strong. In short, we have a passion for great beer and we hope you get a chance to enjoy it. Interested in learning more about our journey from our small brewery on Taylor Road to now?
